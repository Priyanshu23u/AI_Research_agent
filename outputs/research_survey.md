# Fake news detection — A Survey

## Abstract

The prevalence of digital communication platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube etc. coupled with soph0nographic technological innovations like deep neural networks make possible the creation of vast amounts of online user generated content daily across multiple channels simultaneously. This abundance poses new problems concerning privacy protection, security threats and quality control issues especially regarding unreliable sources who deliberately create false stories about people, companies and governments either due to political motives or personal vendettas – often called “fake news”. To tackle this issue effectively requires systematic efforts involving multidisciplinary expertises spanning computer science fields ranging from natural language processing(NLP), image recognition algorithms, graph analytics methods amongst others all working together towards developing robust systems capable of accurately identifying whether particular piece of textual material originated from credible source versus noncredible ones quickly enough before they cause irreversible harmful consequences resulting from being shared widely via mobile devices screenshots containing photos/video clips embedded into articles posted onto webpages serving millions upon millions users per day globally every minute around clock . Furthermore , since most individuals lack necessary knowledge skills required deal directly dealing breaking down complicated technical terms explaining why certain items should considered trustworthy while another shouldn’t ; therefore educators must play active role providing basic understanding concepts behind making informed decisions based solely facts rather than emotions driven narratives craftily manipulated intended deceiving audiences minds leading them astray away reality ground truth situation actual happening occurrences present taking place presently elsewhere earth surface planet Earth itself .

## Introduction

In recent years, the prevalence of false narratives circulated via digital platforms poses critical threats to societal trust and informed decision-making processes across diverse sectors such as politics, healthcare, finance, and education. This phenomenon—falsely termed 'Fake News'—is characterized by deliberately crafted stories intended to deceive audiences into believing unverified claims presented under the guise of credible sources [Zhou et al., 2019]. Such occurrences undermine objective truth discovery mechanisms pivotal for maintaining transparency and accountability essential to functional governance structures globally. Consequently, considerable scholarly efforts have been dedicated towards developing robust computational models capable of identifying dubious articles prior to wide distribution while they remain relatively obscure online before gaining traction amongst users - henceforting what could aptly be described as ‘Early Stage’ Fake News Detectio
